# Complexity analysis
## Time complexity: 
- Heapify: O(nlogn)   (O(n) when setting up heap, but extracting elements is O(nlogn))
- ShiftUp(insert elements into heap one by one): O(nlogn)
- In-Place-Heap-Sort: O(nlogn)
## Space complexity:
- Heapify and ShiftUp are O(n). They both set up new space.
- In-Place-Heap-Sort: O(1)
