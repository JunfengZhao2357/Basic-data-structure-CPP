## InsertionSort ï¼šTime complexity analysis almost O(n^2)
- In the worst case, time complexity will reduce to O(n^2).
- But genrally, insertion sort will break the two layers for-loop before it traverse all elements.
- In some nearly order sequences, insertion sort has the beat performance whose time complexity is almost O(n)<O(nlogn).
